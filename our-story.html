      <p>
        Duality is inherent in the ideal of Reciprocity. So it makes perfect
        sense. Our Story begins at the intersection of two journeys with
        different beginnings yet the same destination.

            <h4>Amit Kumar</h4>
            <p>
              As a freelance developer, Amit had always identified with the open
              source software community. He loved the emphasis on sharing,
              transparency, inclusion, and universal contribution. A firm belief
              that everyone has something to share. During his time at Stanford
              Business School, he discovered this ethos was plentiful. Coupled
              with a desire to make the most of the amazing group of people he
              was connected to, he built a Reciprocity prototype that was
              quickly adopted by his class - and recognized by the
              administration.

            <h4>Corey Breier</h4>
            <p>
              In a parallel universe, Corey was exploring the concept of a
              ‘friendly CRM’ born from his desire to build something that
              created currency in quality time with loved ones, rather than
              revenue. Raised in Palo Alto as the son of a VC, he was immersed
              in the West Coast way of business where everyone forges
              introductions with the intention of making things easier for all.
              Corey was consulting on projects with similar intentions when a
              mutual friend of Amit’s from an accelerator recognized the
              resonance between their two visions and offered to introduce the
              two. Reciprocity begat Reciprocity.
